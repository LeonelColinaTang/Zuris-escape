                    Zuri has woken up in an enchanted forest where monsters are looming and lurking everywhere! 
                    He managed to escape his prison but now a shadow dog is chasing him and the only way of escape 
                    is to chant the magic words to keep shadow dog away.
                    But there's a catch! If you fail, you will strengthen shadow dog. 
                    You have the keys to save or doom Zuri

                        ... Then he grew up and went back to the forest with a flamethrower and burned it to the ground.
